# Rails Start!

"Rails Start" is a starter kit for Ruby on Rails applications, designed to help developers quickly set up a new project with essential features and best practices.

This project is a perfect choice for:

- For enterprises looking to standardize their Rails application setup.
- Freelancers and agencies to kickstart client projects.
- Online education platforms to start teaching Ruby on Rails.
- Individual developers who want a solid foundation for their Rails applications.

## The Idea

Rails Start is a project built on the idea of providing a ready-to-use template that includes:

- Docker and Docker Compose for easy environment setup.
- Devcontainer support for consistent development environments.
- Advanced using of "make" and "Makefile" for task automation.

"Rails Start" makes everything explicit and easy to understand, allowing developers to focus on building their applications rather than setting up the environment.

## How to Use

- `git clone https://github.com/the-teacher/rails-start.git`
- `cd rails-start`
- `make rails-start`

That is it! Very simple.

Now visit: `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.
